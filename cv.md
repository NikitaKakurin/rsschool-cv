#### About me:
Hi, I am currently working as an electrical engineer, I have a higher education in automation of production systems, but I really want to become a frontend developer. I started learning programming many times, but for a number of life reasons, I temporarily stopped studying, but the desire to learn does not leave me. I hope that this time I will be able to get a job.
